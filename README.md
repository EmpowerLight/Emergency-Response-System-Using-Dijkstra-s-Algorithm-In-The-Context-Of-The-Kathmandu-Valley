# Emergency Response System Using Dijkstra's Algorithm In the Context Of The Kathmandu Valley

## Overview

The Emergency Response System is a web application designed to provide efficient and prompt response to emergencies. It leverages a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, while the backend is powered by Python, Flask, and SQLite. The system incorporates Dijkstra's algorithm for route calculation, ensuring quick and optimal paths for ambulances to reach users in distress.

## Features

- User registration and authentication for secure access.
- Automatic selection of the nearest ambulance using route calculation.
- Ambulance dispatch functionality for quick response.
- Seamless integration with hospital locations for patient transport.

## Technology Stack

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Leaflet API for mapping).
- Backend: Python, Flask, SQLite.
- Algorithm: Dijkstra's algorithm for route calculation.
